## Get SSL certificates
Choose one of the following options to install SSL certificates:

### Option A: Install certificates via certbot
 * Add either a wildcard A record in your domain for `*.your.domain`, or multiple records for each subdomain defined in `/var/www/setup/certificates_install.sh`
 * Add an A record for root domain `your.domain`, OR comment/remove config in `/var/www/setup/certificates_install.sh` and `/var/www/config/auth.conf`
```
bash /var/www/setup/certificates_install.sh contoso.com
```

### Option B: Copy wildcard cert or individual subdomain certs to the server and replace the file path in the following files to refer to your files:
```
/var/www/config/auth.conf
/var/www/html/device-certificates/device-certificates.conf
/var/www/html/device-fingerprint/device-fingerprint.conf
```

## Get API keys
 * Create an account and get your API key from
   * <https://fingerprint.com/>
   * <https://twilio.com/>
   * <https://console.cloud.google.com/>
